## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
"是在" <- `哈樓`
```

```{r}
"是在" -> `哈樓`

```

```{r}
C(1:5) -> numbers

```

```{r}
myList <- list(
  zone1 <- list(1,2,3), # A
  zone2 = c("a","b","c"), # B
  factor(c("economics","sociology","sociology")), # C
  `%share`= c(11,33,48,55) #D
)
